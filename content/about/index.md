I began my software development journey five years ago, driven by curiosity and a passion for problem-solving. Now, as a Software Developer at Savannah Informatics, I build and optimize healthcare technology solutions that serve communities across East Africa. I work on electronic medical record systems and digital health platforms that transform how healthcare is delivered.

My unique background blends technology with businessâ€”a Commerce degree focusing on finance, followed by software engineering training at ALX Africa. This combination allows me to approach development with both technical expertise and business insight.

I specialize in full-stack development, continuously expanding my skillset to create applications that are not just functional, but also drive real business value. My portfolio showcases the diverse technologies I've mastered and my commitment to creating impactful digital solutions.

As you explore my portfolio, I invite you to consider the diverse suite of technologies I have mastered and the unique perspective I bring to software development.
