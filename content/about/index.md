Five years ago, I embarked on an incredible journey as a software developer. My adventure in the realm of coding began not in a classroom, but in the vast expanse of the digital world. My path led me to the comprehensive and intricate landscape of full-stack development. This journey was fueled by my passion for solving complex problems and my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.

Currently, I'm a proud member of the [Spraxa Solutions Pvt Ltd](https://www.spraxa.com/) family, where I wear the hat of a Software Developer. Here, my days are filled with the challenges and triumphs of building, testing, and refining a management system for Steris Corporation's inventory. Each bug fixed and each line of code improved is a step forward in this ever-evolving landscape.

My educational path took an interesting turn, blending technology with business. After starting my academic journey with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at [Kabarak University](https://kabarak.ac.ke), I later delved into the intricacies of software engineering at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering/). This has not only broadened my perspective but also deepened my understanding of the software engineering world.

Before you delve further into my portfolio, I'd like to present the suite of technologies that I've mastered.
