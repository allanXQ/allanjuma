Five years ago, I embarked on a transformative journey into the world of software development, beginning not in a traditional classroom, but within the boundless realms of the digital universe. My adventure has taken me through the comprehensive domains of full-stack development, driven by a relentless passion for tackling complex problems and an insatiable desire to expand my knowledge.

Currently, I am a dynamic Software Developer at Spraxa Solutions Pvt Ltd, where I am deeply involved in the development, testing, and enhancement of a sophisticated inventory management system for Steris Corporation. Each bug I resolve and every line of code I optimize mark progress in this ever-evolving field, as I contribute to our team's success and the system's efficiency.

My academic background uniquely blends technology with business. I began with a Bachelor of Commerce from Kabarak University, focusing on finance, and later pursued software engineering at ALX Africa. This combination has enriched my approach, allowing me to see software development through a business-enhancing lens and leveraging technology to drive organizational success.

As you explore my portfolio, I invite you to consider the diverse suite of technologies I have mastered and the unique perspective I bring to software development.
